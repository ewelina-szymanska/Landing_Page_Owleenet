        <img src="images/icon_cm.png" class="icon" alt="ewelina's social media icon">

    
        <p>As an art therapist trained in Poland, I was seeking ways to enhance the cognitive function and fine motor skills of my current clients. I found the solution in traditional Polish craft. While Papercraft was once used mainly for decoration 150 years ago, today cutting and gluing have become a form of self-discovery.</p> 
        <p>Wycinanki Papercraft is a great way to engage in creative activities that can benefit people of all ages and skill levels. This printable paper craft is perfect for art therapy and leisure activities. It can help improve hand strength, fine motor coordination, stimulate imagination, and provide a unique way to unwind and reduce stress.</p> 
        <p>The journey to self-discovery is about finding your unique path, and enjoying the process. Let's start your folder with Wycinanki patterns and get creative!</p>

    <section class="FAQ">
        <h2 class="h2_subscription">Here are some commonly asked questions to help you get started with our Wycinanki Art</h2>

        <div class="accordion_box">
            <button class="accordion">What exactly are Wycinanki?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Wycinanki is the art of layering and cutting coloured paper to create intricate designs, often depicting animals, birds, or geometric shapes. This traditional folk art has been around for at least 150 years and is still enjoyed today in Poland.</p>
            </div>
    
            <button class="accordion">Will safe scissors be provided during the class?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Our scissors are specifically designed for little hands, featuring rounded tips and plastic blades to ensure safe paper cutting, without any risk to hair or skin. Each session starts with a quick safety reminder on the proper usage of scissors, such as cutting away from the body and keeping scissors away from fingers, hands, arms, and legs, never trying to catch a dropped pair of scissors.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">How can I make a payment for the class?</button>
            <div class="panel">
